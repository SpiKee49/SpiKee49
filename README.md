# Hello fellow visitor ðŸ‘‹  
My name is RenÃ©, I'm 23 years young university student from Slovakia. I'm interested in web design and development, oftentimes in graphic design as well.

ðŸ“ƒ As a person I'm trying my best to be as possitive as I can, even in serious situations I seek for oportunities to fit in a small joke or pun. Not that I'm rude or disturbing, I just like to uplift some tension from the air, not just for me but mostly for people around me. 

ðŸ’œI love to laugh, but even more I love to make other people laught.

All in all im modest guy, who's very shy at first, but open minded in the end. I'm not afraid to present my opinion, even if it's against majority of people. I like to learn new things and gather as much relevant knowledge as I can.
